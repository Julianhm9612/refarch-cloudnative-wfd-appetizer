### Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of Appetizer Microservice. The appetizer microservice retrieves the list of appetizers from its data store. 

- Based on [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/).
- Integrated with the [MicroService Builder](https://developer.ibm.com/microservice-builder/).
- Deployment options for local, Docker Container-based runtimes, Minikube environment and ICP/BMX.

### How it works

Appetizer Microservice serves [**What's For Dinner**](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-wfd), Microservice-based reference application. Though it is a part of a bigger application, Appetizer service is itself an application in turn that gets the data from data store. This service reads the data and returns it through a REST service.

### Endpoints

```
GET     /WfdAppetizer/rest/health/        # Health check of the service
GET     /WfdAppetizer/rest/appetizer/     # Returns the appetizers available
```

### Implementation

#### [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/)

MicroProfile is an open platform that optimizes the Enterprise Java for microservices architecture. In this application, we are using [**MicroProfile 1.2**](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-bom). This includes

- MicroProfile 1.0 ([JAX-RS 2.0](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=339), [CDI 1.2](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346), and [JSON-P 1.0](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=353))
- MicroProfile 1.1 (MicroProfile 1.0, [MicroProfile Config 1.0.](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config))
- [MicroProfile Config 1.1](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config) (supercedes MicroProfile Config 1.0), [MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance), [MicroProfile Health Check 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health), [MicroProfile Metrics 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics), [MicroProfile JWT Authentication 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth).

You can make use of this feature by including this dependency in Maven.
